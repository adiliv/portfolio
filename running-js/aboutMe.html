        <h2>Hi! :)</h2>
        <p>My name is Adi Livne, I live in Tel Aviv.
            <br> In the last year I’m going through a career change to full stack software development. I’d like to fit in as
            a junior developer.
            <br> I have a B.A. in management from the Open University and investments portfolios management license from the Israeli
            Security Authority.
            <br> I have 7 years experience in the capital market as a trader, reviews writer, back-office and regulation positions.
            <br> I have analytical capabilities, high expression and writing ability, and excellent interpersonal skills.</p>
    
        <h3>In my spare time...</h3>
        <p>I try to see as many sunsets as I can (my favorite spot is Charles Clor park)<br>
        <img src="C:\Users\ADI\I\bootcamp\week1/20170728_193536.jpg" rotate="180" width="200" alt="sunset"><br>
        I also try to do as much as I can yoga class (lately discovered that in the same favorite spot for sunset.. ;).<br>
        also love music, flowers, nature, traveling, movies, shows, cats.. these are a few of my favorite things :). (i wish i'd new how to put each word in shapes like stars or hearts..)
        I have big visions waiting for me to learn to code them..</p>
